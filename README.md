🧙‍♀️ I'm Emma, a research scientist consultant and engineer with a PhD in Sound and Music Computing, based in Paris (France). 

📝 To learn more about my research, please visit my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0PvSz8cAAAAJ&hl=eng). 

👀 I’m interested in analysis focused on user experience and product analytics. I primarily use Python, R, SQL, and Tableau as tools.

🎶 I love music and sounds (I use SuperCollider, Max/MSP, and Pd) and I enjoy taking/editing [pictures](https://emserpics.tumblr.com/). 

📫 To contact me, please send me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmafrid)!
