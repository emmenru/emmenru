🧙‍♀️ I'm Emma, a researcher and engineer with a PhD in Sound and Music Computing, based in Paris (France). 

📝 To learn more about my research, please visit my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0PvSz8cAAAAJ&hl=eng). 

👀 I’m interested in music tech and data-driven methods to enhance user experience and ensure accessibility for all. Python and R are my favorite tools.

🎶 I love music and sounds (I use SuperCollider, Max/MSP, and Pd) and I enjoy taking/editing [pictures](https://emserpics.tumblr.com/).
