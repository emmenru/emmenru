- 🔭 I’m Emma, an engineer with a PhD in Sound and Music Computing based in Paris (France). 

- 👀 I’m interested in analysis and prediction focused on user experience and product analytics. I primarily use Python, R, SQL, and Tableau as tools.

- 🎶 I love music and weird sounds (I work in SuperCollider, Max/MSP, and Pd) and I enjoy taking/editing [pictures](https://emserpics.tumblr.com/). 

- 📫 To contact me, please send me a message on [LinkedIn](emmafrid)!
